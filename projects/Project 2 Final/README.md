# Template p5 project

For this program, I really wanted to experiment with how to lead the user in,
perhaps with counterintuitive, "anti-design" methods. I'm not sure it is entirely
successful on that point, but the process of development has been very enlightening
for my understanding of opaque and obscure design.

I also wanted to wrap this experimentation in a strange, mystical package that
draws from the cluttered and confusing HUDs of old PC games and RPGs. The two
games you mentioned in response to my Project Proposal were fascinating and
definitely inspiring. One thing I wish is that I had more time to develop and
depict a more interesting, mythical narrative for this program.

The program begins with "tutorial" and "intro" sections that are intended to
maintain a certain level of obscurity while also informing the user of what is
possible in this program. Namely, the use of spatial audio, the mouse, and the
arrow keys.

The "tutorial" scene is the most brutally basic thing to start off with. Its so
rudimentary I'd say it counts as ugly. I also imagine it could likely turn most
users away. Hopefully you won't immediately write the program off!

However, I thought it was interesting to start with the most barebones version of
what was needed in order to teach the user how to use this program, without anything
written or explicitly stated. I also have a tendency to overload and go maximalist
with all of the oscillating opacities and over-the-top 3D creatures. I thought
it could be an interesting contrast to begin with the exact opposite. There is
nothing to tell the user that they are even on a functioning website other than
a cell cursor, some distorted audio drone, and an awkwardly placed grey circle
off to the side.

My hope is that after this hyper-minimalist start, the user will be surprised
and possibly even intrigued by the change in visual fidelity (and ongoing audio
drone) while also having learned a fundamental lesson from the program regarding
its use of spatial audio and the mouse.

My intention was to continue to teach the user in the next scene as well. This
time by asking the user to press the up arrow key within a time window of the
gate being open.

For the "game" section, I am conflicted about the end result. I like the way it
looks. The HUD was an enormous pain in the ass to get right in terms of positioning
but it worked out in the end. I've been wanting to try out something like that
for a long time. However, I'm not wild about how the "game" actually plays.

I wish there was a 3D component in the viewport to make the top down movement
around a rectangular playing field more interesting. If I had more time I would
have liked to have added more complexity to the actual gameplay. I tried my best
to add complexity to the code wherever I could, though its revealing of my skill
level that I don't always know the best way to do that. I suppose complexity for
complexity's sake isn't great anywho!

Regrettably, I also couldn't figure out how to get my actual initial concept across.
I would still love to make a game where the player controls two separate entities
that are attempting to reunite, each with an entirely different POV and set of
controls.

All that being said, I enjoyed this process and learned a lot. On a selfish level
I am wicked disappointed that you won't be around to teach next year. However, I'm
so happy for you and your family that you finally get some time off. Just FYI,
your classes are truly incredible. I'm sure you know this, but it bears mentioning.
I've never seen a teacher so organized, invested, and talented at getting difficult
tech topics across to stoner grandmas like me. Thanks so much for this year, your
classes were by far my favorite that I have ever taken.

Hope you have a wonderful year off, hope to meet in person at some point!
